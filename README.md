Algorithm Repository
====================

This repository contains a collection of algorithms that I have learned and used for problem-solving. These algorithms cover various areas such as graph algorithms, dynamic programming, sorting, searching, and common techniques. They were learned as part of the Phitron XPSC Club, a competitive and problem-solving club.

## Graph Algorithms
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):**
  - **Kruskal's Algorithm:** Finds the MST using edge sorting and the union-find structure.
  - **Prim's Algorithm:** Finds the MST using a priority queue.
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:** Finds shortest paths between all pairs of nodes.
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** Finds shortest paths from a single source node, handles negative weights.
- **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):** Also known as Union-Find, helps in finding and merging disjoint sets.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Traverses the graph level by level.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Traverses the graph depth-wise.

## Dynamic Programming
- **Knapsack Problem Variations:**
  - **0/1 Knapsack:** Standard knapsack problem with items being either included or excluded.
  - **Bounded Knapsack:** Each item can be included up to a certain number of times.
  - **Unbounded Knapsack:** Each item can be included any number of times.
- **Choice Problems:** Problems involving making a choice at each step to optimize the result.
- **Common DP Algorithms:**
  - **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS):** Finds the longest increasing subsequence in an array.
  - **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):** Finds the longest subsequence common to two sequences.
  - **Edit Distance:** Calculates the minimum number of operations required to convert one string into another.
  - **Coin Change:** Finds the number of ways to make change for a given amount using given denominations.
  - **Partition Problem:** Determines if a set can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum.
  - **Fibonacci Sequence:** Calculates the nth Fibonacci number using memoization or tabulation.

## Sorting Algorithms
- **Merge Sort:** A divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts by merging sorted subarrays.
- **Quick Sort:** A divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts by partitioning the array.
- **Selection Sort:** Sorts by repeatedly finding the minimum element and moving it to the sorted part of the array.
- **Bubble Sort:** Sorts by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements that are in the wrong order.

## Searching Algorithms
- **Binary Search:** Efficiently finds an element in a sorted array.
- **Advanced Binary Search:** Variations of binary search for different problem settings.
- **Linear Search:** Finds an element by checking each element in the array.

## Common Techniques
- **Bit Manipulation:** Techniques to manipulate bits for solving problems efficiently.
- **Bit Masking:** Uses bit masks to represent subsets and solve problems.
- **Two Pointer Technique:** Uses two pointers to solve problems involving pairs of elements.
- **Slow and Fast Pointer:** Also known as the tortoise and hare algorithm, used in cycle detection.
- **Prefix Sum:** Precomputes sums of subarrays for efficient range sum queries.
- **Sliding Window:** Solves problems by maintaining a window that slides over the array.
- **Frequency Array:** Uses arrays to count frequencies of elements.

## How to Use
Each algorithm is implemented in its own file with detailed comments explaining the steps and logic. You can browse through the repository to find the specific algorithm you are interested in. The code is organized by category for easy navigation.
